### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Adrian, and I am an aspiring software engineer with a background in Engineering Management. I love solving problems, taking on challenges and learning new things to build projects that are exciting! I also love getting outdoors, travelling and playing sports.

I am confident working with Python, JavaScript, SQL as well as a number of libraries and frameworks such as Vue.js, node.js, Flask.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deepening my understanding of Vue.js and deploying full-stack web apps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning system design architecture, app security and making my apps look pretty.
